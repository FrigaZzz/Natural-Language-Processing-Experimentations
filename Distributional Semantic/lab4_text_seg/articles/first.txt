1 tram route, a predecessor to Trolleybus Route 20, was opened by the British Shanghai Tramways on 21 January 1908 and ran between the Jing'an Temple and The Bund.
Trolleybus Route 20 subsequently opened on 27 September 1928, initially operating between Zhongshan Park and the Jing'an Temple.
After the removal of tram tracks along Nanjing Road in 1963, Yingshang No.
1 and route 20 merged, forming a single trolleybus route (which continued using the route number 20) that ran between Zhongshan Park and The Bund.
In 1999, due to the conversion of part of East Nanjing Road to a pedestrian-only shopping street, Route 20 was rerouted to skip the segment via Jiujiang Road.
In 2019, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all 25 trolleybuses running along the route were decorated with pictures depicting the history of the route.
That year, it was estimated that as many as 9 out of 10 Shanghai residents have ridden on the route.
In the same year, due to the conversion of the Nanjing Road pedestrian-only street to cover the entire East Nanjing Road, the terminus was shifted from Jiujiang Road & East No.1 Zhongshan Road to Hankou Road & Middle Sichuan Road.

1 tram route, a predecessor to Trolleybus Route 20, was opened by the British Shanghai Tramways on 21 January 1908 and ran between the Jing'an Temple and The Bund.
Trolleybus Route 20 subsequently opened on 27 September 1928, initially operating between Zhongshan Park and the Jing'an Temple.
After the removal of tram tracks along Nanjing Road in 1963, Yingshang No.
1 and route 20 merged, forming a single trolleybus route (which continued using the route number 20) that ran between Zhongshan Park and The Bund.
In 1999, due to the conversion of part of East Nanjing Road to a pedestrian-only shopping street, Route 20 was rerouted to skip the segment via Jiujiang Road.
In 2019, to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, all 25 trolleybuses running along the route were decorated with pictures depicting the history of the route.
That year, it was estimated that as many as 9 out of 10 Shanghai residents have ridden on the route.
In the same year, due to the conversion of the Nanjing Road pedestrian-only street to cover the entire East Nanjing Road, the terminus was shifted from Jiujiang Road & East No.1 Zhongshan Road to Hankou Road & Middle Sichuan Road.
In 1975, New York restaurateur Sirio Maccioni flew to the Canadian summer home of Italian Baron Carlo Amato, Shangri-La Ranch on Robert's Island, Nova Scotia.
Maccioni and his two top chefs began experimenting with game and fish, but eventually the baron and his guests wanted something different.
Maccioni then mixed butter, cream and cheese, with vegetables and pasta and brought the recipe back to New York City.
The fame of pasta primavera traces back to Maccioni's New York City restaurant Le Cirque, where it first appeared as an unlisted special before it was made famous through a 1977 article in the New York Times by Craig Claiborne and Pierre Franey which included a recipe for the dish.
The invention of the dish is contested; Le Cirque co-owner Sirio Maccioni claimed that his wife Egidiana threw it together from ingredients on hand during a trip to Nova Scotia; Ed Giobbi, an amateur cook himself, claims to have shown Maccioni and Jean Vergnes (then executive chef at Le Cirque) a similar dish which Vergnes then slightly modified, and chef Franco Brigandi claims to have invented it while the maitre at Il Gatto Pardo Ristorante in New York City and prepared it for Bob Lape on WABC television before his dish was requested to be cooked by other culinary practitioners.
Maccioni states that Vergnes and his subsequent French chefs refused to allow pasta to be served at Le Cirque, so the many requests for the dish had to be satisfied with a pot set up in a hallway to cook pasta, and plates were finished in the dining room by wait staff away from the chefs' watchful eyes.
The combination of lightly cooked vegetables and pasta, which Claiborne and Franey hailed as "by far, the most talked-about dish in Manhattan", is widely recognized as one of the signature developments of American cuisine in the 1970s.

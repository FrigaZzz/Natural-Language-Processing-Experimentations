    "\n",
    "Implementazione della teoria delle valenze di Patrick Hanks per costruire cluster semantici basati su un verbo specifico. Utilizzando un corpus e un parser sintattico, si estraggono i fillers per i ruoli di soggetto e oggetto del verbo, convertendoli in tipi semantici. Si richiede un corpus con almeno alcune centinaia di istanze del verbo.\n",
    "\n",
    "L'esercitazione si compone dei seguenti step:\n",
    "- Estrapolazione delle frasi contenenti il verbo scelto dal dataset.\n",
    "- Parsing delle dipendenze della frase.\n",
    "- Individuazione dei componenti dipendenti del verbo nell'albero di parsing, selezionando le dipendenze di tipo \"nsubj\" e \"dobj\" (soggetto e oggetto).\n",
    "- Disambiguazione del soggetto e dell'oggetto utilizzando il WordNet e l'algoritmo di Lesk.\n",
    "- Identificazione del supersenso (tipo semantico) sia per il soggetto che per l'oggetto.\n",
    "- Calcolo delle frequenze delle coppie di supersensi (cluster semantici).\n",
    "- Visualizzazione dei risultati ottenuti."

    "Per facilità, ho deciso di estrarre direttamente le frasi dal corpus SemCor utilizzando la libreria NLTK. La funzione \"extract_sentences_with_word\" prende in input una parola e un nome di file di output. Scorre tutte le frasi nel corpus SemCor e salva le frasi che contengono la parola specificata nel file di output. Ad esempio, ho utilizzato questa funzione per estrarre tutte le frasi che contengono la parola \"see\" e salvarle nel file \"see_sentences.txt\".\n",

Questi approcci offrono la possibilità di ottenere una maggiore precisione nella determinazione dei sensi delle parole.\n",

Ad esempio, se la frase è \" I saw it flyng away \", si potrebbe supporre che 'it' faccia riferimento ad un animale/volatile e quindi associarlo a 'noun.animal'.È importante tenere presente i limiti e le peculiarità del dominio specifico in cui si opera, ma l'implementazione di regole custom può essere una soluzione praticabile.
